Description:

Functions_SGPriorites.R
Functions for running the models and the prioritisition algorithms

Run_TrawlScenarios.R
Script that runs the models and algorithms used to generate the results in the main paper. 
Depends on 'Functions_SGPriorites.R' and 'Base_params.R'
It will also save tables of priority actions and their costs in the 'tables' and 'maps' folders. 

Base_params.R
Base parameters used for the results in the main paper. 

boat_estimation.csv
Estimated number of pleasure yachts for each planning unit in the study region. 
seagrass_threats01.csv
For each planning unit (PUID), the cover of seagrass, number of trawl days, the
presence of fish farms and the settlement influence factor. 

seagrass_threats001.csv
seagrass_threats005.csv
As above but with lower 'alpha' values (see paper), for the rate of decline of settlement impact with distance.
